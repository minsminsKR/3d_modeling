# Temple prologue — work in progress

The prologue is not connected to the game yet. New-game entry, the forest,
prayer interaction, two-day presentation, directional smoke, gate transition,
pause and save behavior, and actual in-game visual/audio review remain to be
implemented and verified. Existing corridor checkpoint entry must remain intact.

## Temple reference and generation

`temple/reference.png` was created using the built-in image generation tool.
Prompt: “Single isolated traditional small Korean Buddhist temple hall (법당),
complete freestanding building for 3D reconstruction, front three-quarter view
showing front and one side, realistic aged timber dancheong, dark grey tiled
roof, stone foundation, closed wooden lattice doors, modest rural mountain temple,
neutral diffuse studio lighting, plain white background, centered entire object
with generous margins, no trees, no people, no ground scenery, no text.
Physically plausible architecture, photorealistic material detail.”

inspect the same job in the webapp before Blender finishing and Unity import.

## Pine reference and generation

`pine/reference.png` was created with the built-in image generation tool.
Prompt: “A single mature Korean red pine tree for realistic 3D game asset
reconstruction, full tree visible including trunk roots and entire irregular
wind-shaped crown, straight-on three-quarter view, weathered reddish bark and
dark green pine needles, asymmetrical natural branching, isolated on pure white
background, soft neutral studio light, no ground scenery, no shadows outside
the tree, no people, no text, no other trees. Photorealistic.”
Request `aad4512f-d2b9-4082-b1d0-939f0fd14b1c`, job
`25f9cb91-165b-4569-9b11-f61dc916bd4d`, Hunyuan3D 2.1, seed 1234,
texture on, submitted 2026-11-03. Inspect and preserve the actual output before
using it in the game. Thin foliage may require particular visual/LOD review.

`TemplePrologueSequence` is an unconnected, engine-independent interaction
sequence. Its CPU check is `dotnet run --project
HappyToyV2/Tools/quality/TemplePrologueTests.csproj` from the repository root.
It does not verify a playable prologue or presentation quality.
